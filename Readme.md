## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>.

The data for the project is available at: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>


The following steps were completed as part of the project: 

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## About the files

The following files are uploaded:

a) run_analysis.R: Code for the various steps to create the required tidy data set. The required files are needed to be in the working directory inside the folder UCI HAR Dataset

b) codebook.md: Description of the variables in data and the code

c) tidydata.txt: Required output data set
